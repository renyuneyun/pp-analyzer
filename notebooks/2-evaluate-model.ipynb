Our online store is hosted by Shopify, Inc. (\"Shopify\"). Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products to you. Accordingly, when you submit personal information in connection with purchases made via our Service, such information is not collected by us, but rather is sent directly to Shopify. When you purchase something using our Service, as a part of the buying and selling process, Shopify collects information from you such as your first name, last name, company name, mailing address, phone number, email address and credit card payment information. Your data is stored through Shopify\\'s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. The information Shopify collects from you is governed by Shopify\\'s privacy policy and other policies located here: http://www.shopify.com/data-processing/privacy-policy and http://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy. According to these policies, Shopify protects credit card information according to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), a set of security requirements managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of the payment brands, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by merchants and service providers. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. The description above is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of Shopify\\'s privacy policies, and you should review the policies posted on Shopify\\'s site to be fully informed.\\nNavdy\\'s Service Providers. We may share your information with third-party contractors, agents, collaborators, data processing providers, data storage providers or service providers who provide certain services to us or on our behalf, such as operating and supporting the Service. We may share information to our service providers such as logs and reports from your Navdy Device. For instance, we use Zendesk to provide customer support services. We may share with Zendesk your e-mails that you send to us and any account information you may provide in order to help address your customer service needs. Additionally, we use Here Maps, a service run by Nokia Corporation to provide you with traffic and map information and with whom we may share information such as your device information and your location.

We may share some or all of your information with our parent company, subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, joint venturers or other companies under common control with us.\\nAggregate Information. We may share information relating to visitors and users of our Service with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties on an aggregate basis. While this information will not identify you personally, in some instances these third parties may be able to combine this information with other data they have about you, or that they receive from third parties, in a manner that allows them to associate this aggregated data with your personal data.\\nLegal Requirements. Navdy may share your information with law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third parties, if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; enforce applicable provisions of the Navdy Terms of Service located at https://www.navdy.com/terms, including investigation of potential violations; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or safety of Navdy, our users or the public as required or permitted by law. We may dispute any third party demands to share your information when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the requests may be enforceable, overbroad, vague or lack proper authority; however, we do not commit to challenge every such demand.\\nPublic Information. To the extent you share any information to a public audience or via a publically accessible portion of the Service, that information will be available to the public.\\nUnforeseen and Unpreventable Disclosure.

How We Use Information We Collect.\\n\\nWe use the information we collect from users of our Service in order to provide you with more meaningful editorial and advertising content and to offer you relevant products and services, as well as to maintain, protect and improve your overall experience. In particular, you may choose (i) to subscribe to any of our electronic newsletters, (ii) to receive \"special offers\" by EMI and its various service providers, (iii) to receive franchise and business opportunity information from selected advertisers, and we will use your information for these purposes provided you have given us your consent. You may also choose (iv) to submit questions or comments in response to editorial content on our Service, or (v) to purchase books and related publications offered on our affiliated website at bookstore.entrepreneur.com (the \"Bookstore Website\") in which case, we will process your information to perform our agreement or comply with your request. In each of those instances you will be asked to provide, and we will collect and store, certain personal information such as email address, zip code, telephone number, and in some instances information about your business. In the case of purchases made through the Bookstore Website, we will also collect and store additional information about those purchases, including titles purchased, quantity and dates of purchases, the method of payment, and other information provided such as billing and shipping addresses (if different). By providing that information and provided you have consented thereto, you acknowledge that it can be used by EMI and its various advertisers and other service providers to send you promotions and other communications concerning business opportunities, products or services. You can remove yourself from any such electronic newsletters and otherwise stop receiving any further promotions and other commercial communications by following the \"unsubscribe\" directions included with each newsletter or, in all of the above instances, by sending an email with the word \"unsubscribe\" in the subject line to unsubscribe@entrepreneur.com.\\nWe may use the name you provide for your EMI Profile across all of the services we offer that require an EMI Account, which is where the information you provide is maintained. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your EMI Account, so that you are represented consistently across all our services.\\nWhen you contact EMI, we retain a record of your communications to help solve any issues you might be facing, or to maintain a record to assist with legal claims. We will keep these records for a period of no more than 6 years. Provided you have consented thereto, we may use your email address to inform you about the products and services offered on our Service, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.\\nWe use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. You can reset your browser to reject all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. But you need to know that you may not be able to access or use some features and services on our Service without cookies. A pixel tag is a type of technology which is placed on a website or within an email and used for the purpose of tracking activity on a website and is often used in combination with cookies. For further information about how we use and collect cookies, see our separate cookie policy located at https://www.entrepreneur.com/cookie-policy .\\nWe do not track our users across third party websites and thus do not respond to Do Not Track (\"DNT\") signals. However, some third party websites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, certain website browsers allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.\\n\\n\\n</segment>\\n\\nThe phrases to classify are:\\n\\n<phrases>\\n[\"titles purchased\", \"quantity and dates of purchases\", \"method of payment\", \"name you provide for your EMI Profile\", \"past names associated with your EMI Account\", \"a record of your communications\"]\\n</phrases>\\n'},\n",
